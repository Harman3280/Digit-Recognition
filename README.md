# Digit-Recognition
Recently Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) becomes one of the most
appealing approaches and has been a crucial factor in the variety of recent success and
challenging machine learning applications such as object detection, and face
recognition. Therefore, CNNs is considered our main model for our challenging tasks of
image classification. Specifically, it is used for is one of high research and business
transactions. Handwriting digit recognition application is used in different tasks of our
real-life time purposes. Precisely, it is used in vehicle number plate detection, banks for
reading checks, post offices for sorting letter, and many other related tasks
